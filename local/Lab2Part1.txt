The motor testing script uses code directly from lecture 2.

The script waits 2 seconds, then sets the duty cycles of the motor and servo to netural.
Then, after 2 seconds, the motor runs at nearly max speed for 2 seconds and turns off (goes back to neutral).
Then, the motor runs in reverse at nearly max speed for 2 seconds and stops.
The servo then sweeps left, right, and back to the center, each taking 2 seconds.

After, the PCA board data structure is "torn down" as lecture 2 states.
